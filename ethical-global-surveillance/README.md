# Ethical Global Surveillance


## Abstract
I am listening to Edward Snowden speak with Joe Rogan, and I am reminded that most (if not all) technology can be used for good.  I want to encourage you to think about using surveillance technology for the good of all.  I want to encourage social media networks to begin the search for heroes among us.

## Background
Many people are currently using technology to search for enemies.  But I am not aware of anyone using technology to search for heroes.

### Human Calculation Problem
All problems in the world are the result of our inability to organize efficiently and effectively.  The ethical surveillance system would help us organize in such a way that our problems are solved more quickly and effectively.

### Sacrifice of Privacy
The hero is willing to sacrifice their privacy to some degree.  This is different than the person who is ignorant of sacrificing their privacy.  And so the social media networks could poll all of their users to tell them about this search for heroes and ask if the individual is interested in having their privacy sacrificed for this noble purpose.

### Negativity Bias
Human nature tends to give more weight to negativity.  Heroes are aware of this bias and as many biases as possible.  A surveillance technology used for good would search for positive people with positive ideas.  The system should search for the peacemakers.

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence with access to people's data could be tasked with identifying heroes and organizing heroes in a way which benefits everyone toward peace, health, and progress.

## Conclusion

My biggest hope is that people can solve all of our problems.  The only thing preventing people from solving our problems is a distribution of power which is not based on merit.
